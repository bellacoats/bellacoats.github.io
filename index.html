    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <h4> this is the closest font i could find to my pattern library </h4>
    <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Bella Coats</strong> and I am a senior here at CU. I go by she/her/hers and my goals for this course are to be able to create websites that are equally functional as they are ~aesthetically pleasing~. I am majoring in Marketing and CTD is my minor. 
        </p>
        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <p >My favorite color is blue and my favorite fruit is mango. I also play club volleyball at CU and am going on my 10th/11th ish year playing competitively.
            Here is a cool <a href="img/bellaimg.jpg">picture</a> of me and my friend at Ouzel Falls in Rocky Mountain National Park!</p>

<h3>To add more content, here are pictures of my family's dog (aka my parents' pride and joy), Archie</h3>
<p> He is a boston terrier and just turned 2. His hobbies include barking at me for not letting him bite my toes and fully consuming pieces of toys that he rips off.</p>
