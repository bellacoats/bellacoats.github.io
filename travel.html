    <h1> An Extremely Specific Travel Bucket List</h1><hr>

<div id="list"> 

    <div id="row1">
        <div id="text">
    <li> <strong>1. Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada</strong></li><br>
        <p>Pictured is Moraine Lake in Banff National Park. If this lake looks this insane in a picture I can only imagine what it would look like in person - probably the most blue water i'll ever see in my entire life.  </p></div> 
        <br><div id="image"> <img src="travel/banff.jpg" alt="Moraine Lake in Banff National Park" width="300" height="300"></div>
    </div>  <br>

    <hr>
        
    <br><div id="row2">
        <div id="image"> <img src="travel/antarctica.jpg" alt="Antarctica" width="300" height="300"></div>
        <div id="text"><br>
    <li> <strong>2. Antarctica</strong> </li><br>
    <p>This one's definitely once in a lifetime. How many people get to say they went to the southernmost part of the entire planet and kayaked among gigantic glaciers?? And hung out with penguins??? Not many, but I would like to say that I have. </p></div><br>
    </div>   <br>

    <hr>
        
    <br><div id="row3">
        <div id="text">
    <li><strong> 3. Ubud, Bali</strong></li><br>
    <p> These rice terraces in Bali truly look like they were made for a video game or some Disney movie. The whole town of Ubud is so lush and green and also crawling with monkeys that might steal things from you. </p></div>
    <br><div id="image"> <img src="travel/bali.jpg" alt="Rice Terraces in Bali" width="300" height="300">
    </div></div>   <br>

    <hr>
        
    <br><div id="row4">
        <div id="image"> <img src="travel/palmyra.jpg" alt="Palmyra Islands in the Pacific" width="300" height="300"></div>
        <div id="text"><br>
    <li> <strong>4. Palmyra Atoll</strong></li><br>
    <p> The Palmyra Atoll is extremely remote and only has a population of about 20 people and they are all staff and scientists working on the island conducting research. I discovered Palmyra in a video series called "VELA" on YouTube posted by pro-surfer John John Florence because he was on a sailing trip and the destination was this amazing Atoll in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. If you can spare an extra hour or so, definitely watch this series. </p>
    <br></div></div> <br>

    <hr>
        
    <br><div id="row5">
        <div id="text">
    <li> <strong>5. Patagonia, Argentina </strong></li><br>
    <p> Again, who gets to say they went to the (almost) southernmost part of the world and got to see these astounding mountains that were the name inspiration for one of the biggest outdoor brands in the world??</p></div>
    <br><div id="image"> <img src="travel/pata.jpg" alt="Patagonia" width="300" height="300">
</div></div> <br>

    <hr>
        
    <br><div id="row6">
        <div id="image"> <img src="travel/teton.jpg" alt="Grand Tetons with a Bison" width="400" height="300">
        </div>
        <div id="text"><br>
    <li><strong> 6. Grand Tetons, Wyoming </strong></li><br>
    <p> The Grand Tetons (as well as Jackson Hole) have been on my travel bucketlist for years now. My next roadtrip is 100% going to be to the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone to see the caldera before it blows up and kills everybody.</p>
    <br></div></div><br>

    <hr>
        
    <br><div id="row7">
        <div id="text">
    <li><strong> 7. Yosemite Horsetail Falls aka Firefall </strong></li><br>
    <p> How embarassing that I'm from California and have never been to Yosemite. My only reasonable excuse is that it's in the opposite end of the state from me making it about a 7 hour drive - but would be worth it nonetheless. There are many places within Yosemite that I want to see but this backlit waterfall would also be close to a once in a lifetime sight. This "firefall" only happens once a year for a few days in February when the sun is perfectly lined up with the water.</p></div><br>
    <br><div id="image"> <img src="travel/yosemite.jpg" alt="Firefall in Yosemite" width="400" height="300">
</div></div><br>


    <hr> 
    <br> <div id="row8">
        <div id="image"> <img src="travel/faroe.jpg" alt="Fossa Falls in Faroe Islands" width="400" height="300"></div>
        <div id="text"><br>
    <li><strong> 8. Faroe Islands </strong></li><br>
    <p> Another waterfall! Except this one is in the Faroe Islands and is called the Fossa waterfall. It is the largest waterfall within the Faroe Islands and can boast some of the most vivid greens and blues you've ever seen. </p><br>
    </div></div><br>


    <hr>    
    <br><div id="row9">
        <div id="text">
    <li><strong> 9. Antelope Canyon, Arizona </strong></li><br>
    <p> Antelope Canyon aka Mars is one of the coolest rock formations I've ever seen. Permits and booking a tour/photography guide are required to go into the canyon. Some people may find this annoying but I've read online that all the guides are extremely informative and are very cool people. The permit and tour fees may add up to more than what you're expecting but I think it's a must-see and would totally be worth it.</p></div>

    </div></div><br>

    <hr>
        
    <br> <div id="row10">
        <div id="image"> <img src="travel/iceland.jpg" alt="Northern Lights in Iceland" width="400" height="300"></div>
        <div id="text"><br>
    <li><strong> 10. Iceland </strong></li><br>
    <p> Last but certainly not least, Iceland. Iceland has been on my bucket list for multiple years at this point. My favorite photographer, Chris Burkard, shoots a lot over there and was the first person to really peak my interest in visiting this country. I also happen to have one of his prints shot in Iceland hanging in my room that I will have until the day I die. From the classic blue lagoon to the colorful rivers to the northern lights - Iceland will be a trip I might never shut up about.</p></div>
