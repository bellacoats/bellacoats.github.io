        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <br>
            <p>My name is Bella and I am 21 years old. I was born and raised in Southern California but have been coming to Colorado since I was 12 because my older sister also went to Boulder and now lives in Denver. I have two sisters and am the youngest of my family aka the favorite. My favorite color is blue and my favorite fruit is mango. I play club volleyball at CU and am going on my 10th/11th ish year playing competitively. I also like photography, snowboarding, going to concerts, hiking, doing yoga, and cooking!
                Here is a cool <a href="img/bellaimg.jpg">picture</a> of me and my friend at Ouzel Falls in Rocky Mountain National Park!</p>

                <h2>Here are pictures of my favorite family member (aka my parents' pride and joy), Archie</h2>
                <br>
                <p> He is a boston terrier and just turned 2. His hobbies include barking at me for not letting him bite my toes and fully consuming pieces of toys that he tears apart.</p>
