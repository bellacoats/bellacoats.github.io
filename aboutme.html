        <h1 class="hello">Hi! I'm <span class="linear-wipe">Bella Coats</span></h1>
        <br>
        <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Bella Coats</strong> and I am a senior here at CU. I go by she/her/hers and my goals for this course are to be able to create websites that are equally functional as they are ~aesthetically pleasing~. I am majoring in Marketing and CTD is my minor. </p>

        <h2>My Interests</h2>
            <p >My favorite color is blue and my favorite fruit is mango. I play club volleyball at CU and am going on my 10th/11th ish year playing competitively. I also like to snowboard, hike, do yoga, and cook!
                Here is a cool <a href="img/bellaimg.jpg">picture</a> of me and my friend at Ouzel Falls in Rocky Mountain National Park!</p>

                <br>

                <h3>Here are pictures of my favorite family member (aka my parents' pride and joy), Archie</h3>
                <p> He is a boston terrier and just turned 2. His hobbies include barking at me for not letting him bite my toes and fully consuming pieces of toys that he rips off.</p>
