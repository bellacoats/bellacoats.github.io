    <h4> a short list of things that I have changed my perspective on as my frontal lobe develops</h4><br><br>
<div id="newtext"> 
    <li> 1. being bad or average at things you enjoy is okay</li>
        <p>I grew up in Southern California which had an average temperature of about 70 degrees year round, yet I love to snowboard. The closest (good) mountain is Mammoth Mountain which is about a 6.5 hour 
            drive away so I didn't get to see snow as much as I would've liked to growing up, especially since most of my time was devoted to 
            playing club volleyball. When I came to Boulder I was actually floored at some of my friend's skiing abilities because I was never exposed
            to that level of skiing or snowboarding. Not saying that I suck. Because I don't. But I definitely get left behind because I'm more of a timid rider
            and therefore am not trying to hit cliffs and be the first one down the mountain and some of my friends get in 200 ski days a year while I have maybe 30 days under my belt in my entire lifetime.
            But I love it! So I continue doing it instead of moping and being sad that I'm not the fastest out of my friend group! And I think that's better.
             </p><br>
    <li> 2. reading</li>
        <p>Before a year or two ago, you could not PAY me to read a book in my free time. One time when I was about 9 or 10 I really REALLY wanted a hamster for some reason. And after constant begging my mom finally caved
            but under "one condition": I read 10 books in one summer. She knew me too well. And I was also a child so I was dumb enough to believe her as if you could even return a HAMSTER to petsmart 3 months after you bought it.
            I was so terrified of losing my beloved hamster, Nibs, that while we were on a family trip in London we were waiting in line for some attraction and I vividly remember sitting in the grass next to my family as we waited in this line
            so that I could read my 10 books and keep my stupid hamster. That didn't contribute to my character development I just thought it was funny. Anyway, people shit on TikTok a lot for it being a time-sucker and 
            spreading misinformation but personally, I am on a side of TikTok that shows me interior design, real estate, cooking videos, satisfying cleaning videos, and a LOT of books!!!! While they may be basic, I now have a 
            stack of books in my room that I really enjoyed and it really does feel good to complete something because I loooOOoove to start shit and never finish it because I get bored or distracted. And now I look forward to 
            having a proper wind-down at night with a book (when I have the time and the attention span). </p><br>
